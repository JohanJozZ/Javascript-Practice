          In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental
          questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?",
          and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your
          first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we
          discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables,
          strings, numbers and arrays.

        <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
        <p class="small-text">
          JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
          implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
          more than just sit there and display static information for you to
          look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
          animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet
          that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the
          layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS)
          we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
          Area.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give
            meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs,
            headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our
            HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and
            laying out our content in multiple columns.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create
            dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
            and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is
            amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small-text">
          The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a
          button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it
          structure and purpose:
        </p>
        <figure class="code-snippet">
          <p class="code-title">HTML</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              &lt;button type="button"&gt; Player 1: Chris &lt;/button&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>

        <img
          class="small-img"
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript/just-html.png"
          alt="html visual representation"
        />
        <p class="small-text">
          Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:
        </p>
        <figure class="code-snippet">
          <p class="code-title">CSS</p>
          <pre>
              <code>
                button {
                  font-family: "helvetica neue", helvetica, sans-serif;
                  letter-spacing: 1px;
                  text-transform: uppercase;
                  border: 2px solid rgb(200 200 0 / 60%);
                  background-color: rgb(0 217 217 / 60%);
                  color: rgb(100 0 0 / 100%);
                  box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(0 0 200 / 40%);
                  border-radius: 10px;
                  padding: 3px 10px;
                  cursor: pointer;
                }
              </code>
            </pre>
        </figure>

        <p class="small-text">
          And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:
        </p>
        <figure class="code-snippet">
          <p class="code-title">Javascript</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              const button = document.querySelector("button");
              button.addEventListener("click", updateName); function updateName() {
              const name = prompt("Enter a new name"); button.textContent = `Player
              1: ${name}`; }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </figure>

        <p class="small-text">Here's a demo of the code in action.</p>
        <button type="button">Player 1: Johan</button>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_can_it_really_do?">
        <header>What can it really do?</header>

        <p class="small-text">
          The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
          programming features that allow you to do things like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for
            instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name
            in a variable called <code>name</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In
            the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the
            <code>name</code> variable to create the complete text label, e.g.
            "Player 1: Chris".
          </li>
          <li>
            Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.
            We used a
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event"
              >click</a
            >
            event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and
            then run the code that updates the text label.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small-text">
          What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top
          of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application
          Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to
          use in your JavaScript code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_running_order">
        <header>JavaScript running order</header>
        <p class="small-text">
          When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs
          it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be
          careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the
          block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-title">Javascript</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const button = document.querySelector("button");
            button.addEventListener("click", updateName); function updateName() {
            const name = prompt("Enter a new name"); button.textContent = `Player
            1: ${name}`; }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="small-text">
          Here we are selecting a button (line 1), then attaching an event
          listener to it (line 3) so that when the button is clicked, the
          <code>updateName()</code> code block (lines 5-8) is run. The
          <code>updateName()</code> code block (these types of reusable code
          blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and then
          inserts that name into the button text to update the display.
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
          If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no
          longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the browser
          developer console —
          <code
            >Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'button' before
            initialization.</code
          >
          This means that the button object has not been initialized yet, so we
          can't add an event listener to it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Interpreted_versus_compiled_code">
        <header>Interpreted versus compiled code</header>
        <p class="small-text">
          You might hear the terms interpreted and compiled in the context of
          programming. In interpreted languages, the code is run from top to
          bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned. You
          don't have to transform the code into a different form before the
          browser runs it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text
          form and processed directly from that.
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
          Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into
          another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++
          are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The
          program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from the
          original program source code.
        </p>
        <p class="small-text">
          JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web
          browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and
          runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most modern
          JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called just-in-time
          compiling to improve performance; the JavaScript source code gets
          compiled into a faster, binary format while the script is being used,
          so that it can be run as quickly as possible. However, JavaScript is
          still considered an interpreted language, since the compilation is
          handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.
